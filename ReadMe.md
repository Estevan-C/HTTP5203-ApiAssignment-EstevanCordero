## Course: XML and Web Services - HTTP-5203-RNA

Summary
- This assignment allows the user to enter a video game, or character to be searched through in the IDGB/Youtube Database.

Comments
- BE WARN THERE IS A QUOTA FOR YOUTUBE API THAT CAN BE REACH IF USED TO MUCH
- Had to make quite a few if statements, I tried to combine into one If Statement but the end results didn't work.
- Comments are left on the index page explaining on what is happening.

Future Plans
- After looking through the IDGB API Document, I notice I could get covers of video games as well as other information. 
This would be a nice touch to included, but it requires more time.
